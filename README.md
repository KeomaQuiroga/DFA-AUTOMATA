# DFA-AUTOMATA
Simulation of a DFA automata. The program receives inputs from a text document.
The document *dfa1.txt* have:
- Automaton states
- Initial state
- Final states
- Automata language (0 - 1)
- Transitions between states
  
The document *pruebas.txt* contains tests with the automaton, the answers of the tests will be written in *resultado.txt*. If the answer is true, the automaton acepts the string.
The documents *dfa.txt* and *pruebas.txt* can be modified, but the language cannot.
